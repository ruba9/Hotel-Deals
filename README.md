# Hotel-Deals
This repository gives a description on a very simple site hosted for free on Heroku that consumes a JSON API as a server-side call and displays Hotel deals in an appealing manner.

the instructions for setting the site up in a local sandbox:
for the Backend:
1- clone the Repo.
2- Download npm and nodejs
3- on CMD write npm install
4- node app.js
5- open your browser on local host 4000.

FrontEnd:
1-Clone Repo
2- install Angular command line 
3- go to the folder you downloaded
4- npm install
5-ng serve

 assumptions I've made about the API:
I assumed that this API returns Data about hotels and not all parameters work as filtering passing params.

 known issues with my example:
you can only filter by destination other params are only for viewing (in the front end only).
