This project was coded using NodeJS for the following reasons:
1) I had a very basic knowledge in JavaScript one year ago as self-study from w3schools.
2) The project does not need many CPU cycles or very hard algorithms 
3) It lets us share code between the browser and the backend
4) IT is event-based so everything can be done on one server


I wanted to create an application that sends request to an API using some filteration parameters to get some hotels deals and displays them on a UI (Front-End) using Angular 2 frame work.
My thought process while building the application was as follows:
1) I read the task multiple times to understand the needed application
2) I put the JSON API on a JSON editor to get a view on the data received so that I can get more understanding on the data formats.
3) I decided which langauges to use, then initiated a project that was tested locally, then deployed my code on Github and Heruko ( after reading about them both).
4) Next, I was not very familiar with front end and how to connect it with my backend code, so I decided to use a framework ( Angular 2) that connects them easily, the reseans I chose it is that it's also based on JS, and  Angular manages your components for you and also serves as the pipeline that connects them, no need for getters /setters
functions.
5) Read how to create github and how to use it.
6) deployed the front end on Github and server.

 In the process I have learnt so much, NodeJS basics, how to use Servers,how to use Angular and connect it with backend, how to use Github.
 all in all, it was a new experience for me as I had so little experience in such languages and frameworks/tools coming from an engineering background that knows only C++.
